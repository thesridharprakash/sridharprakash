This Mysuru roadshow was fast, crowded, and full of short public interactions that matter for campaign storytelling.

Instead of only filming the main convoy, I tracked side-lane conversations and neighborhood reactions.

## What stood out in Mysuru

- Crowd energy changed by locality and time of day.
- Women and first-time voters were more likely to engage in one-to-one conversations.
- Volunteers needed quicker social clips during live movement.

## Tactical media notes

- Keep captions location-specific for better local reach.
- Publish route updates in real time for stronger engagement.
- Use one-minute recap videos for better cross-platform reuse.

Roadshow coverage works best when content is immediate, local, and easy to understand.
