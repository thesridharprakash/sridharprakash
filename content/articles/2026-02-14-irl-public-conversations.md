IRL coverage is not about forcing a viral moment.

It is about making people comfortable enough to share what they actually think.

During this week, I tested two approaches:

1. Direct question format with quick cuts
2. Conversation-first format with slower pacing

The second format performed better and got stronger comments. People stayed longer and engaged more because they felt the clip had depth.

## Practical adjustments I made

- Started each clip with place + context in one sentence
- Reduced background music volume for clearer voices
- Added subtitles faster to improve watch time

## Why this matters for campaign work

Political content becomes more effective when it feels human, local, and clear. My goal is to keep building this style for both social media growth and meaningful public engagement.
