Academic Freedom or Selective Outrage?

No serious nationalist argues against academic debate. Universities must discuss history, conflict, and public policy.

But there is a difference between:

Studying a conflict

And presenting narratives that consistently portray the Indian state as villainous while ignoring terrorism, insurgency, and national security realities

If campuses repeatedly host one-sided portrayals of national institutions, people will question the intent — not the debate.

Freedom of expression does not mean freedom from scrutiny.

The “Urban Naxal” Anxiety

The term “urban Naxal” has entered public vocabulary because of a long-running Maoist insurgency that has cost thousands of lives. While courts determine individual guilt, the broader concern is real:

Can extremist ideologies exploit intellectual spaces to gain legitimacy?

When armed insurgents operate in forests and ideological sympathisers allegedly operate in cities, the public grows wary. Whether one agrees with the terminology or not, the fear of ideological radicalisation is not imaginary.

National security is not paranoia. It is a constitutional duty of the state.

Campuses Shape the Next Generation

Universities are not neutral factories. They shape:

Journalists

Bureaucrats

Academics

Policy influencers

If young minds are consistently exposed to narratives that frame the nation-state as oppressive and illegitimate, what long-term impact does that have?

Healthy criticism strengthens democracy.
Systematic delegitimisation weakens it.

There is a line — and universities must be conscious of it.

Nationalism Is Not a Dirty Word

In recent years, nationalism has been portrayed in some circles as regressive or authoritarian. But nationalism, at its core, is simply loyalty to the nation’s sovereignty and unity.

Supporting the armed forces.
Respecting constitutional institutions.
Recognising the sacrifices made to protect territorial integrity.

These are not extremist ideas. They are foundational principles of any stable country.

The Responsibility of Institutions

Universities must ensure:

Debate is balanced, not ideological propaganda

Law and order is strictly maintained

Political activism does not override academic purpose

If administrations appear hesitant to draw boundaries, they risk losing public trust.

India’s taxpayers, parents, and students expect institutions to produce leaders who strengthen the nation — not divide it.

The Final Word

This is not about silencing dissent. It is about preventing the normalisation of narratives that erode national cohesion.

Democracy survives on debate.
Nations survive on unity.

The challenge before Indian universities is clear:
Encourage critical thinking — but never lose sight of national responsibility.

Because when the line between scholarship and subversion becomes blurred, society will demand clarity.

And rightly so.
