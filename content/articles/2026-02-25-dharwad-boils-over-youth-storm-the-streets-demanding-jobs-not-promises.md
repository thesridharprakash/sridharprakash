Dharwad witnessed intense protests as hundreds of students and government job aspirants took to the streets demanding immediate recruitment to vacant government posts across Karnataka. The demonstrators alleged that lakhs of positions remain unfilled, leaving educated youth waiting for years with little clarity on recruitment timelines.

Protesters, including graduates and competitive exam aspirants, expressed frustration over delayed and irregular hiring processes. Many claimed they had spent years preparing for exams such as KPSC, only to face postponements and uncertainty. For them, the issue extends beyond employment — it is about fairness, transparency, and respect for their efforts.

As the crowd gathered in key areas of the city, police presence increased and barricades were set up to manage the situation. Brief detentions of student leaders added to the tension. Protesters questioned the state government’s priorities, asking why recruitment drives could not be conducted in a timely and transparent manner.

While political parties traded blame over the backlog of vacancies, students maintained that their protest was about stalled careers and growing unemployment, not party politics. The demonstration in Dharwad reflects a broader concern among Karnataka’s youth over limited job opportunities and delayed appointments.

With assurances of review and action expected from the government, many are watching closely to see whether concrete steps will follow. For the protesting students, visible and time-bound recruitment measures remain the key demand.
