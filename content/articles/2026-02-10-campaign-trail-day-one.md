Today was my first full day of political campaign coverage on the ground.

I started with one clear rule: listen first, record second.

Across meetings, street corners, and volunteer groups, the strongest moments were not the loudest ones. The best stories came from people speaking about daily issues in simple language.

## What I learned

- People respond to honesty faster than polish.
- Short clips work best when they include context, not just slogans.
- Ground coverage needs patience. The real story often appears between events.

## Content plan from this day

- 3 short reels with local voice clips
- 1 day recap vlog
- 1 field-note post with observations and lessons

This is the format I want to keep: real places, real people, and consistent public documentation.
