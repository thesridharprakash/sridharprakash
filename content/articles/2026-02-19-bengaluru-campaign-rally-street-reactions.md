Today I covered a major campaign rally in Bengaluru with one goal: capture what people were actually saying outside the stage speeches.

I spent time near entry points, tea stalls, and volunteer desks to collect real public reactions.

## Key observations from Bengaluru

- Local voters were focused on traffic, jobs, and ward-level accountability.
- Young volunteers were highly active on social media distribution.
- Short on-ground clips performed better than edited speech highlights.

## Content produced from this rally

1. Rally recap reel with crowd context
2. Voter voice clips for Instagram and YouTube Shorts
3. End-of-day field reflection for the journal

Ground reports like this help keep political content closer to people, not just podiums.
